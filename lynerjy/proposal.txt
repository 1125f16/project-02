Project Proposal

0. Objectives

The project will be an agent based model of idea diffusion. People will be able to come to a website to understand how different parameters affect the spread of ideas in a network.


1. Agent-based model
An agent based model will be developed to show how individuals traverse a problem landscape (that will be defined by the dataset). There are 3 elements that make up such a model: a) an NK model, which is an evolution model which has been adapted to model the interdependence between parts of a problem and the varying value of its solution, b) a network model, which represents how, say, individuals in an organization are connected to one another, or how firms are connected in a field, and c) a search algorithm defining how these individual nodes decide to interact with one another and with the problem space.

3. Visualization
The simulation of this network will be shown using d3.js. The user will be able to manipulate this graph, and save different simulations that they run.
