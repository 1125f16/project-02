The setup for running the analysis engine was a bit tricky since I needed a cluster big enough to be able to generate enough data with ample resources to be used for the engine. Portability and deployment was another concern that I had to consider. 

I have divided the project into 4 main parts:
 1. Collection of necessary data. 
2. Deployment of the spark cluster. (/deployment)
3. Code for doing the analysis (/src)
4. Save the data for visualization  (/visualization)

Here is the repository for the engine: https://github.com/robinjha/pie
