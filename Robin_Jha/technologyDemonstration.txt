I have implemented the data collection agents for disk usage on a Mesos datacenter (DC) of 50 nodes, which is currently polling every 2 minutes (code for this is not checked in).

Besides this I was able to launch docker containers for spark framework consisting of master and slaves on the same DC. 

Code for deployment is currently checked into git repository: https://github.com/robinjha/pie
