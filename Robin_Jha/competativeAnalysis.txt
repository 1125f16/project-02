Predictive analysis is gaining a lot of traction and there are quite a few companies currently working on it. IBM IT Operations Analytics (https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/it-operations-analytics/us/en-us - product-header-top) is doing something similar to my proposal. However, after some exploration I found there was a fundamental difference in our approach as it was tightly coupled with different IBM components, which essentially meant running an IBM solution throughout the cluster, which can be a limiting factor. 

This goes against the plug and play model I am trying to implement with my analytics engine where you could have different data sources such as events, logs, metrics, etc. feeding into the engine for analysis. I have not come across any existing services that offer what I am trying to achieve for my project.
